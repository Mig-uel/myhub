# Next.js Notes

## Notes

- Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build server-side rendered applications.
- The @ symbol is used to refer to the root of the project.
- All components in Next.js are server-side rendered by default unless you specify otherwise.
- You can specify a component to be client-side rendered by adding 'use client' to the component.
- To export a mongoose model in Next.js and to avoid overwriting a model, you have to use || to check if the model already exists
- If it does not exist, you can export the model. If it does exist, you can use the existing model.
